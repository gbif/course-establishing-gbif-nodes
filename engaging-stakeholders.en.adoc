== Engaging stakeholders towards establishing a node
[NOTE.objectives]
In this section, you will:

* explore through *three practical excercises* how you can get involved in engaging stakeholders to make the case for formal GBIF Participation and for the establishment of a new node. 

* use the <<use-case,use case scenario>> for the fictious country of Darwinia as the context for the exercises, but we encourage you to consider at each step how this applies to your own national or organizational context.

Remember that discussing your approach to these exercises with your peers and mentors will help you to refine your ideas and strengthen your case. The GBIF nodes work together as a community, recognizing the importance of collaboration and learning from others' experiences to develop the capacity of GBIF as a whole.

=== Engaging stakeholders

When building a case for a country to join GBIF, it is important to start by identifying all the stakeholders (actors and parties) that would be concerned with GBIF Participation, and then considering which of these will be most helpful. 

*Key audiences*

GBIF’s communication strategy is a helpful resource in identifying the key audiences and messages to communicate to them to build engagement. 
It can also help you consider the stakeholder groups to engage when building a case for GBIF participation within your country or network. 

[NOTE.documentation]
Review the https://docs.gbif.org/gbif-communications-strategy/1.0/en/[GBIF communication strategy^], focusing on the audiences and the roles they could play in becoming a GBIF Participant and establishing a node.

==== Prioritizing stakeholders - Exercise 1

TIP: This exercise is based on the <<use-case,use case scenario>> for the fictious country of Darwinia.  
Please refer to the context provided in the use case scenario when providing your answers in the exercise sheet. 

One way to guide the thought process around prioritizing who to engage in building a case for GBIF Participation is to map the stakeholders onto a matrix that looks at:

. How likely each stakeholder is to support the desired outcome (in this case, the country becoming a GBIF Participant and establishing a node)
. How much influence each stakeholder is likely to have on the outcome (remembering that for a country to join, signature of the MOU may come from a minister or senior official in a relevant government department or designated national agency)

[NOTE.activity]
In your exercise sheet, referring to the use case scenario, identify all the stakeholders to engage in making a case for GBIF Participation and map them onto the priorization matrix. Keep track of your rationale for where you have placed the stakeholders, and any points you would wish to discuss with your peers. 

[NOTE.forum]
While working on this activity, we encourage you to consider how this would apply to your national context and keep track of any items you wish to discuss during the first group call.

=== Targeting stakeholders' interests 

As we have seen throughout this course, GBIF provides value across a range of scientific and policy-relevant thematic areas, and the benefits of participating in GBIF are wide ranging, from technology and infrastructure-related benefits, to capacity development, to supporting research, and to helping to fulfil national commitments under related multilateral environmental agreements. 
The https://docs.gbif.org/gbif-communications-strategy/1.0/en/[GBIF communication strategy^] introduces the importance of targeting your messages to align with the needs and interests of your specific audience.

Remember that GBIF Participant countries may have different priorities and interests depending on which Ministry signs the Memorandum of Understanding: for example, Ministries of Environment often oversee the responsibilities under the Convention on Biological Diversity, while Ministries of Science may oversee research infrastructures and funding within the country.

==== Preparing a pitch - Exercise 2

For this exercise, you will prepare and role-play a succinct and convincing pitch to a relevant Ministry of your choice in order to engage them towards GBIF Participation. 

In preparing your pitch, consider the specific needs and interests of the Ministry you wish to target. 

A pitch should be short - you should be prepared to deliver it within no more than three minutes.
The aim is to provide just enough information to prompt interest and questions that will allow you to provide additional details in response.

[quote, GBIF Communication Strategy] 
GBIF’s future depends in part on remaining useful and relevant to a relatively small number of decision makers in key policymaking and funding positions. 
If these funders and executives are unconvinced of GBIF’s utility value, it will not survive even if all other aspects of its communication strategy are successful.
The communication needs of this group are characterized by *brevity and clarity; messages must be conveyed strategically, succinctly and persuasively, and often delivered opportunistically and at short notice*. Decision makers are the primary consumers of the ‘elevator pitch’—the 30-second explanation of GBIF’s value that can influence participation or withdrawal of support from governments and agencies.

[NOTE.activity]
Develop and role play a pitch based on the <<use-case,use case scenario>> for the fictious country of Darwinia. 
Document your pitch in your exercise sheet.
Consider also the types of questions that a Ministry representative might ask in response to a pitch on GBIF, and keep note of these in your exercise sheet.

* *Step 1*: Decide which Ministry you intend to target from Darwinina. Explain why you have chosen this Ministry.

* *Step 2*: Write out your pitch, targetting what you think would be the main rationale for joining GBIF that would be of interest to the Ministry you have selected. This can be in the form of a complete script, or just bullet points to cover the points you wish to raise.

* *Step 3*: Organize a session to role play your pitch with your peer learning group.  You will need to allocate at least 60 minutes for this session and remember to record the session.

** Take it in turn to role play the delivery of a pitch, remembering to inform your group which Ministry you are targeting.
** The other group members can ask questions, taking on the role of Ministry representatives.
** Once you have all completed the exercise, take some time to provide each other with feedback. Consider what went well, and what could be done to make it even better next time. 

* *Step 4*: Upload your group's recording into the shared folder.


TIP: Make sure to have fun with this activity - and remember that practice will really help!

=== Participatory approach 

Establishing a node is one of the commitments that Participants make when joining GBIF.  
We recommend that Participants start planning for their node as early as possible in the process of joining GBIF. 

Nodes play an essential role in helping to coordinate activities relating to GBIF within the country or organization’s scope and in linking these to the global network. 
Having an effective node is essential to ensuring that the Participant benefits fully from their membership in GBIF. 

[NOTE.documentation]
Read the sections on https://docs.gbif.org/effective-nodes-guidance/1.0/en/#what-do-nodes-need[what nodes need to be effective^] and on https://docs.gbif.org/effective-nodes-guidance/1.0/en/#establishing-process[the recommeneded process for establishing a Participant node^] in the nodes guidance document.

:figure-caption!:

image::img/web/ParticipatoryApproach.png[align=center,width=796,height=534]

GBIF recommends taking a participatory approach to establishing a node, in order to build collaboration among the key stakeholders and establish a clear mandate for the node from the start.
The decision on where to situate a node within the landscape of stakeholder institutions will impact the node's focus and priorities. 
The potential advantages and disadvantages of the typical hosting institutions are discussed in the nodes guidance document. 

In an ideal scenario, nodes will have access to a strong team and appropriate budget to enable them to carry out all the https://docs.gbif.org/effective-nodes-guidance/1.0/en/#node-services[services that nodes provide^] that we looked at in an earlier section.
Often, however, nodes start with a small team and limited resources.
In order to be most effective, nodes should consider which roles are essential for them to carry out, and which can be delegated to other stakeholders in the network they will be establishing. 
A good way to formalize these collaborations and shared roles is to establish *governance structures*, such as a board or steering committee, as well as advisory committees, such as a scientific advisory committee.

[NOTE.documentation]
Read a https://www.gbif.org/article/4ZQrCFLXzaLD9Ph5Tp97kZ/establishing-a-national-biodiversity-information-facility-in-chile[guiding example^] from the node in Chile, in which they discuss the establishment of their node through a process involving needs assessment and community consultation.

==== Scoping a node - Exercise 3

In this final exercise, we will return to the context set out in the <<use-case,use case scenario>> for the fictious country of Darwinia and assume that you were successful in gaining the attention of the Ministry with your pitch in Excercise 2. You will now be tasked to scope out a recommendation for the establishment of a Darwinia node. 

TIP: There are multiple valid ways to approach this exercise - we are not expecting a single 'right' solution here. Focus on explaining the node model that you choose and why you think it would be a good model for Darwinia. When providing your rationale, you can refer to details provided in the use case and you should feel free to imagine other details to strengthen your explanations.

[NOTE.activity]
In your exercise sheet, referring to the use case scenario, develop a recommendation for the establishment of a new Participant node in Darwinia. 

* *Step 1*: Imagine that you have been appointed to oversee a national stakeholder workshop to develop a recommendation for the establishment of a node in Darwinia. During this meeting, you discuss the priorites for the new node and agree that they are:

** 1.	Training and supporting institutions that hold and produce biodiversity data in data management and data publishing via GBIF to increase the data availability for Darwinia.
** 2.	Establishing a community of practice among potential users of GBIF-mediated data to increase the use of data in research and policy.
** 3.	Establishing a GBIF hosted portal to provide information on the node activities and access to the data available about biodiversity in the country.
** 4.	Developing a strategy for data mobilization in the country, based on analysis of current data availability and user needs.

Consider which institution from Darwinia you would recommend to be the host for the node. Identify three likely advantages and three possible disadvantages of this host institution compared to other potential node host institutions. Relate this decision back to the priorities for the node.

* *Step 2*: Describe a governance structure for this new node, including a board and advisory committee(s):
** Which institutions would participate in the governance?
** How will the governance structure provide guidance and oversight of the work of the node?
** What benefits would this governance model bring to the Node?

* *Step 3*: Describe a staffing model for the new node.
** What type of skills/what sort of profile would you be looking for in someone who could take on each role?
** Which tasks would each staff member be responsible for?
** If you can only have two staff members, which roles would you prioritize?

* *Step 4*: Send this to your peers for review. When reviewing, compare the answers to your own and provide feedback on any missing perspectives.


[NOTE.forum]
While working on this activity, we encourage you to consider how this would apply to your national context and keep track of any items you wish to discuss during the first group call.
