== Building a case for formal engagement in GBIF

[NOTE.objectives]
*Objectives*

In this module, we will:

* describe what is involved in the modes of formal GBIF Participation and the benefits this brings
* understand how individuals, institutions and countries can participate in GBIF
* identify and prioritize stakeholders to engage in moving towards GBIF Participation


=== Understanding GBIF's value
The starting point for building a case for a country or international organization to formally participate in GBIF is to understand the value of GBIF as data infrastructure and an international network. 
In this section, we will explore GBIF’s relevance through a series of videos focusing on the contributions to research and policy thematic areas. 

[NOTE.activity]
While watching the videos in this section, consider and take note of rationale that could help you to build a case for participation in the GBIF network.
You will need these rationale for the activities later in the course.

[NOTE.presentation]
In this video (10:08) from the GBIF Impact and Action Symposium, 2021, GBIF's Executive Secretary, Dr. Joe Miller, discusses GBIF's relevance for science and policy. 
If you are unable to watch the embeded Vimeo video, you can download it locally.

[NOTE.presentation]
In these six videos (<15:00) you will learn about the value of GBIF. 
If you are unable to watch via the embeded Vimeo showcase, the videos can be downloaded locally from the <<downloads,downloads page>>.

=== Process for becoming a GBIF Participant

In this section, you will review the details on the process for becoming a member of GBIF and explore examples provided in news items about new GBIF Participants.

TIP: Before going further, go back and review the https://docs.gbif.org/course-introduction-to-gbif/en/introduction-to-gbif-participant-nodes.html[Introduction to GBIF Participant nodes section] of the pre-requisite course, in which we discussed the modes of formal Participation in GBIF as an intergovernmental network and research infrastructure. 

The details of how to become a member of GBIF, the description of Participant categories, the GBIF Memorandum of Understanding, and other templates are all provided on the GBIF website in the section about https://www.gbif.org/become-member[how to become a member^]. Read through this information in detail as is important to understand this process before moving on to the rest of the course. 

[NOTE.activity]
To learn more about how countries and organizations join GBIF, explore examples of new Participants available in recent news items.

* Go to the https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=news[news section of the GBIF website]
* Look for new items related to new Participants joining the network, such as:

.News item on Sierra Leone joining GBIF as a Voting Participant in 2022.

* For these examples, look more closely at:
** Which Ministry or Institution has signed the MOU?
** Who has been assigned as Head of Delegation and Node Manager? 
** Which reasons are given for why the Participant joined GBIF?

* Keep note of these examples in your exercise sheet


=== Benefits of GBIF Participation and of establishing a node

Establishing a node is one of the key commitments in joining GBIF. 
In building a case for a country or international organization to join GBIF, you will need to explain the benefits of GBIF Participation and the benefits of establishing a node.

[NOTE.activity] 
Read statements from GBIF Participants on how they communicate GBIF’s value, and consider how they relate to the context of your country or organization.

In 2019, GBIF Participants were asked to provide statements on how they summarize GBIF’s value and communicate it to colleagues and funders. 
Review the examples provided here, and consider how they could help to communicate GBIF’s relevance to your country or organization.
