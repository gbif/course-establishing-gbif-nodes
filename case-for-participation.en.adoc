== Building a case for formal engagement in GBIF

[NOTE.objectives]
*Objectives*

In this module, we will:

* describe what is involved in the modes of formal GBIF Participation and the benefits this brings
* understand how individuals, institutions and countries can participate in GBIF
* identify and prioritize stakeholders to engage in moving towards GBIF Participation


=== Understanding GBIF's value
The starting point for building a case for a country or international organization to formally participate in GBIF is to understand the value of GBIF as data infrastructure and an international network. 
In this section, we will explore GBIF’s relevance through a series of videos focusing on the contributions to research and policy thematic areas. 

[NOTE.activity]
While watching the videos in this section, consider and take note of rationale that could help you to build a case for participation in the GBIF network.
You will need these rationale for the activities later in the course.

[NOTE.presentation]
In this video (10:08) from the GBIF Impact and Action Symposium, 2021, GBIF's Executive Secretary, Dr. Joe Miller, discusses GBIF's relevance for science and policy. 
If you are unable to watch the embeded Vimeo video, you can download it locally.

[NOTE.presentation]
In these six videos (<15:00) you will learn about the value of GBIF. 
If you are unable to watch via the embeded Vimeo showcase, the videos can be downloaded locally from the <<downloads,downloads page>>.

=== Process for becoming a GBIF Participant

In this section, you will review the details on the process for becoming a member of GBIF and explore examples provided in news items about new GBIF Participants.

TIP: Before going further, go back and review the https://docs.gbif.org/course-introduction-to-gbif/en/introduction-to-gbif-participant-nodes.html[Introduction to GBIF Participant nodes section] of the pre-requisite course, in which we discussed the modes of formal Participation in GBIF as an intergovernmental network and research infrastructure. 

The details of how to become a member of GBIF, the description of Participant categories, the GBIF Memorandum of Understanding, and other templates are all provided on the GBIF website in the section about https://www.gbif.org/become-member[how to become a member^]. Read through this information in detail as is important to understand this process before moving on to the rest of the course. 

[NOTE.activity]
To learn more about how countries and organizations join GBIF, explore examples of new Participants available in recent news items.

* Go to the https://www.gbif.org/resource/search?contentType=news[news section of the GBIF website]
* Look for new items related to new Participants joining the network, such as:

:figure-caption!:
.News item on Sierra Leone joining GBIF as a Voting Participant in 2022.
image::img/web/NewsItem.png[align=center,width=640,height=360]

* For these examples, look more closely at:
** Which Ministry or Institution has signed the MOU?
** Who has been assigned as Head of Delegation and Node Manager? 
** Which reasons are given for why the Participant joined GBIF?

* Keep note of these examples in your exercise sheet


=== Benefits of GBIF Participation and of establishing a node

Establishing a node is one of the key commitments in joining GBIF. 
In building a case for a country or international organization to join GBIF, you will need to explain the benefits of GBIF Participation and the benefits of establishing a node.

[NOTE.activity] 
Read statements from GBIF Participants on how they communicate GBIF’s value, and consider how they relate to the context of your country or organization.

In 2019, GBIF Participants were asked to provide statements on how they summarize GBIF’s value and communicate it to colleagues and funders. 
Review the examples provided here, and consider how they could help to communicate GBIF’s relevance to your country or organization.

*Australia*

The major biodiversity assessment and monitoring challenges confronting nations are inherently transnational and thus demand data at such scale. 
The Global Biodiversity Information Facility delivers three key functions for Australia.

. First, it provides the national and global biodiversity research community access to the best available transnational data to support their work.
. Second, it provides a global focal point to foster data interoperability, promulgation of data standards and architectural alignment, which inherently leads to a smoother flow of data.
. And finally it allows Australian biodiversity data generated by collections, museums, researchers, ecological monitoring and citizen science programs to deliver impact globally. 
Conversely, it allows Australian researchers and decision makers access to data that would be otherwise hard to obtain for purposes such as biosecurity risk assessment and climate change scenario planning.

GBIF has achieved what few other environmental domains have been able to achieve globally and acts as a strong exemplar to scientific and research funding infrastructure initiatives of the level of coordination and cooperation within the biodiversity domain.

*Belgium*

GBIF is a unique infrastructure delivering access to a vast quantity of evidence data from various sources (specimens, observations, monitoring). 
It is a fantastic indexation tool for biodiversity data. 
It provides a powerful common denominator aggregating data tool.  

Thanks to capacity enhancement programmes and numerous training workshops, GBIF	succeeded to create a vibrant community of nodes supporting data publishers and users around the globe. 

GBIF’s Data Citation mechanism is amongst the most advanced in open data and open science landscape.

[quote, Canada, Input to tour-de-table discussion, 2019]
____
In communicating the value of GBIF to colleagues and funders, Canada emphasizes that:

* GBIF provides Canadian citizens and stakeholders with an easy, reliable one-stop source available anywhere for accessing Canadian and global biodiversity information, wherever the data was generated;
* GBIF provides great added value from the perspective that it facilitates aggregating relevant data from different sources and reviewing data quality which can be very labour-intensive.
* Like many other countries, the Government of Canada committed to an Open Government Strategy. Membership in GBIF and contribution of Canadian biodiversity datasets directly supports Open Government activities.
* Participation in GBIF also contributes to Canada’s data and information requirements for Canadian commitments to intergovernmental processes. 
For example, having detailed biodiversity data contributes to the Convention for Biological Diversity’s Aichi Target 19 on the sharing of biodiversity knowledge and also on target 9 (invasive species), target 11 (protected areas), target 12 (avoiding extinctions), and target 13 (conserving genetic resources).
